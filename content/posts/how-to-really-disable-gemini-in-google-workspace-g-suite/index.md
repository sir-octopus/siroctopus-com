As at January 2025, Google makes it difficult to disable their AI darling Gemini in Google Workspace. While they have [documentation for turning off access to parts of Gemini](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome), disabling its hooks into Gmail, Drive, Chat, and Meetings may be hidden from you.

If you go to [Admin](https://admin.google.com/) > Generative AI > Gemini for Workspace and see an unhelpful "No more settings to show" error, you will need to *request* access to those settings. 

* In Admin, in the top-right, click the ? icon
* Ask for a human
* Ask them for access to the settings in Gemini for Workspace, noting the "No more settings to show" error

You will then be able to disable Gemini for Gmail, Drive, Chat, and Meetings.
