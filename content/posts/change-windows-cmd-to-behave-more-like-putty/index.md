**Note: Better yet, use the [Terminal app](https://aka.ms/terminal) in Windows 10 and 11**

Having used both the Windows command line and then used PuTTY to control Linux machines, I miss the simple copy and paste functions PuTTY offers however these are already built into CMD!

Simply open a command prompt, click the ```C:\_``` icon in the top-right and select Properites… In the Options Tab, in the Edit Options group, tick the Quick Edit Mode and Insert Mode check boxes.

There you have it, now selections in the command prompt will automatically be copied to the clipboard and right-clicks will perform the paste operation _a la_ PuTTY.
