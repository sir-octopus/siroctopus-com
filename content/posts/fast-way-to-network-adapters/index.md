Still remember in Win95 when changing an IP or DNS server was as easy as going to the Control Panel, opening the network folder then choosing the adapter? Rember in WinXP when you get there without even leaving the start menu? Driven insane by Win10's constantly changing settings interfaces from _every_ previous OS with zero cohesion? Well now you can get to your beloved adapters quicker with three easy steps:

1.  ```Win+R``` (Run)
2.  Type: ```ncpa.cpl```
3.  ```<ENTER>```
